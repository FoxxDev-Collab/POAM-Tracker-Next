# Vulnerability Center Roadmap (Updated)

## Current Implementation Status
Based on codebase analysis, here's the current state:

### Phase 1: Enhanced Vulnerabilities Module - COMPLETE
- **File Upload Component**: Drag-and-drop interface for .nessus files
- **Parser Engine**: Parse Nessus XML format and extract vulnerability data
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity and handle malformed files
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time import progress with error handling
- **Tenable Essentials UX**: Mirror the familiar workflow and data presentation

### Phase 2: Restructured STP System - COMPLETE
- **STIG STPs**: Move current STP system to "STIG STPs" submenu
  - Existing CAT I auto-selection process remains unchanged
  - Current test case creation workflow preserved
- **Nessus STPs**: New parallel system for vulnerability-based STPs
  - Auto-generate STPs from Critical/High Nessus findings
  - Similar test case creation workflow as STIG STPs

### Phase 3: File Manager Module - NEXT PRIORITY
**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**
**Goal**: Comprehensive file management center for STP evidence and security documentation

### 3.1 Core File Storage Infrastructure
- **File Upload System**: Drag-and-drop interface with progress tracking
- **Storage Backend**: Secure local storage with metadata tracking
- **File Validation**: Type checking, size limits, security scanning
- **Association Engine**: Link files to STPs, test cases, and remediation evidence

### 3.2 STP-Centric File Management
- **Per-STP File Overview**: Dashboard showing all files uploaded per STP
- **Security Mapping**: How files relate to security controls and findings
- **Evidence Repository**: Dedicated space for manual STIG checks and Nessus CVEs
- **Cross-STP Awareness**: View related files across STIG and Nessus STPs

### 3.3 Full CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Upload new files with metadata and associations
- **Read**: View file details, versions, and associations
- **Update**: Edit file metadata, re-associate with different STPs
- **Delete**: Remove files with confirmation and audit trail

### 3.4 Version Control System
- **Historical Versions**: Track file changes over time
- **Version Comparison**: View differences between versions
- **Rollback Capability**: Restore previous versions if needed
- **Change History**: Audit log of all file modifications

### 3.5 Integration Features
- **Evidence Linking**: Attach files as proof of remediation
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced filtering by STP, security control, file type
- **Bulk Operations**: Select and manage multiple files simultaneously
- **Preview System**: In-browser preview for common formats
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions (ISSO, auditor, admin)

### Technical Implementation
- API endpoints: `/api/file-manager/*`
- Database tables: `files`, `file_versions`, `file_associations`, `file_audit_log`
- UI components: FileUploader, FileDashboard, VersionHistory, EvidenceViewer
- Backend: Multer integration for file handling

### Phase 4: Advanced POAM System - FOLLOW-UP
**Timeline: 4-5 weeks**
**Goal**: Multi-tier POAM management with automation and compliance integration

### 4.1 Three-Tier POAM Architecture
- **System Level POAMs**: Individual system vulnerability remediation
- **Group Level POAMs**: Cross-system issues with NIST control mapping
- **Package Level POAMs**: Enterprise ATO package compliance planning

### 4.2 Automation and Intelligence
- **Milestone Auto-Generation**: Create from STP test cases and CVE data
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time completion status and metrics
- **Risk Integration**: CVSS scores and custom risk matrices
- **NIST Control Mapping**: Automated control associations

### 4.3 Enhanced Features
- **Reporting Engine**: Automated compliance and progress reports
- **Workflow Management**: Approval processes and task assignments
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Executive-level visibility
- **Export Capabilities**: PDF/Excel report generation

### Technical Implementation
- Database schema: Enhanced POAM tables with hierarchy
- API integration: `/api/poams/*` with advanced filtering
- UI enhancements: Multi-level views, progress charts, reporting interface

## Implementation Timeline & Priorities

### Weeks 1-3: File Manager Foundation
- Core storage and upload system
- Basic file management UI
- Integration with existing modules

### Weeks 4-6: File Manager Advanced Features
- Search/filter capabilities
- Bulk operations
- Preview and version control

### Weeks 7-11: Advanced POAM System
- Multi-tier architecture
- Automation features
- Enhanced reporting

### Risk Mitigation
- **Incremental Deployment**: Each feature can be deployed independently
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance
- **Rollback Plans**: Quick reversion capabilities

## Success Metrics
- File Manager: 100% of evidence files stored and accessible
- POAM System: 80% reduction in manual milestone creation
- User Adoption: Positive feedback from security teams
- Performance: Sub-second response times for file operations

**Total Estimated Timeline: 8-11 weeks**
**Start Point**: File Manager Module implementation
