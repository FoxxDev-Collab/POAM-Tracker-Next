This prevents many types of use-after-free vulnerabilities at little performance cost.

Redzoning adds padding (red zones) around SLUB-allocated objects to detect overflows or underflows by triggering a fault when adjacent memory is accessed. SLUB canaries are often more efficient and provide stronger detection against buffer overflows compared to redzoning. SLUB canaries are supported in hardened Linux kernels like the ones provided by Linux-hardened.\n\nSLAB objects are blocks of physically contiguous memory.

In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.\n\nTerminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.\n\nRHEL 9 utilizes /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of \"ClientAliveInterval\" and \"ClientAliveCountMax\" are used to establish the inactivity threshold. The \"ClientAliveInterval\" is a timeout interval in seconds, after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The \"ClientAliveCountMax\" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client.

Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR keyboards, mice and pointing devices, and near field communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DOD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the Authorizing Official (AO). Even though some wireless peripherals, such as mice and pointing devices, do not ordinarily carry information that need to be protected, modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise the RHEL 9 operating system.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-OS-000299-GPOS-00117, SRG-OS-000300-GPOS-00118, SRG-OS-000424-GPOS-00188, SRG-OS-000481-GPOS-00481","check_content":"Verify there are no wireless interfaces configured on the system with the following command:\n\nNote: This requirement is Not Applicable for systems that do not have physical wireless network radios.\n\n$ nmcli device status\n\nDEVICE                    TYPE            STATE                    CONNECTION\nvirbr0                      bridge         connected             virbr0\nwlp7s0                    wifi              connected            wifiSSID\nenp6s0                    ethernet     disconnected        --\np2p-dev-wlp7s0     wifi-p2p     disconnected        --\nlo                             loopback    unmanaged           --\nvirbr0-nic                tun              unmanaged          --\n\nIf a wireless interface is configured and has not been documented and approved by the information system security officer (ISSO), this is a finding.","documentable":"false","mitigations":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","mitigation_control":"","responsibility":"","security_override_guidance":"","ia_controls":"","check_content_ref":{"name":"","href":""},"legacy_ids":[],"ccis":["CCI-001443"],"group_tree":[{"id":"V-258040","title":"SRG-OS-000299-GPOS-00117","description":""}],"createdAt":"2025-08-27T15:41:42.775Z","updatedAt":"2025-08-27T15:41:42.775Z","status":"not_applicable","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":"Scan performed via SteelCloud ConfigOS by user JPRICEUSER on 08/27/2025 @ 08:36:06.\r\nPart 1\r\nFinding Details: System does not have a physical wireless network radio.\r\nPart 1 Status: Notapplicable\r\nCurrent Status: not_applicable"},{"uuid":"864bbc02-7f17-4bfc-a742-7de4bd6c79a6","stig_uuid":"d5fd2c2a-f3dd-43d5-aada-f7de2411316e","group_id":"V-258041","group_id_src":"V-258041","rule_id":"SV-258041r1038967","rule_id_src":"SV-258041r1038967_rule","target_key":"617fdbf9-35d8-475a-8c12-2a759716439b","stig_ref":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Security Technical Implementation Guide :: Version 2, Release: 4 Benchmark Date: 30 Jan 2025","weight":"10.0","classification":"Unclassified","severity":"medium","rule_version":"RHEL-09-411010","rule_title":"RHEL 9 user account passwords for new users or password changes must have a 60-day maximum password lifetime restriction in /etc/login.defs.","fix_text":"Configure RHEL 9 to enforce a 60-day maximum password lifetime.\n\nAdd or modify the following line in the \"/etc/login.defs\" file:\n\nPASS_MAX_DAYS 60","reference_identifier":"","group_title":"SRG-OS-000076-GPOS-00044","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","discussion":"Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked; therefore, passwords need to be changed periodically.

Security function is defined as the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.\n\nPolicycoreutils contains the policy core utilities that are required for basic operation of an SELinux-enabled system. These utilities include load_policy to load SELinux policies, setfile to label filesystems, newrole to switch roles, and run_init to run /etc/init.d scripts in the proper context.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227, SRG-OS-000134-GPOS-00068","check_content":"Verify RHEL 9 has the policycoreutils package installed with the following command:\n\n$ dnf list --installed policycoreutils\n\nExample output:\n\npolicycoreutils.x86_64          3.3-6.el9_0                                                 \n\nIf the \"policycoreutils\" package is not installed, this is a finding.","documentable":"false","mitigations":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","mitigation_control":"","responsibility":"","security_override_guidance":"","ia_controls":"","check_content_ref":{"name":"","href":""},"legacy_ids":[],"ccis":["CCI-001084"],"group_tree":[{"id":"V-258081","title":"SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227","description":""}],"createdAt":"2025-08-27T15:41:42.776Z","updatedAt":"2025-08-27T15:41:42.776Z","status":"not_a_finding","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":"Scan performed via SteelCloud ConfigOS by user JPRICEUSER on 08/27/2025 @ 08:36:06.\r\nPart 1\r\nFinding Details: Found package policycoreutils.\r\nPart 1 Status: Passed\r\nCurrent Status: PASSED"},{"uuid":"29673dc2-b775-4b60-bc15-f7f145f09b34","stig_uuid":"00b07e79-50a3-43ea-b167-dc9c3c254462","group_id":"V-258082","group_id_src":"V-258082","rule_id":"SV-258082r1045166","rule_id_src":"SV-258082r1045166_rule","target_key":"dfc392c5-3d71-4889-8b58-4ba3b962b903","stig_ref":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Security Technical Implementation Guide :: Version 2, Release: 4 Benchmark Date: 30 Jan 2025","weight":"10.0","classification":"Unclassified","severity":"medium","rule_version":"RHEL-09-431030","rule_title":"RHEL 9 policycoreutils-python-utils package must be installed.","fix_text":"Install the policycoreutils-python-utils service package (if the policycoreutils-python-utils service is not already installed) with the following command:\n\n$ sudo dnf install policycoreutils-python-utils","reference_identifier":"","group_title":"SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","discussion":"The policycoreutils-python-utils package is required to operate and manage an SELinux environment and its policies.
