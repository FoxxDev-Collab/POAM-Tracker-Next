## üìà **CURRENT STATUS UPDATE** *(January 25, 2025)*

### ‚úÖ **PHASE 1 & 2 PROGRESS UPDATE**

#### Recently Completed *(January 2025)*
- **Vulnerability Center UI Enhancements** ‚úÖ
  - Fixed group page asset management UI issues
  - Removed redundant "Add System" functionality (moved to RMF Center)
  - Updated terminology from "systems" to "assets" throughout UI
  - Implemented proper shadcn/ui table with CAT I/II/III compliance data
  - Fixed API data mapping issue with systems response format
  - Consolidated asset management into comprehensive STIG Status table
  - Resolved console errors and improved error handling

#### Immediate Next Priority: **NIST Catalog CCI Mapping Integration**

### üéØ **PHASE 2.5: CCI MAPPING + NIST COUPLING** *(Q1 2025 - HIGH PRIORITY)*

**Core Integration Goals:**
- Wire NIST Control Catalog to CCI mappings for ATO packages
- Package compliance determined by poorest-performing system/group (worst-case scoring)
- Complete end-to-end STIG ‚Üí CCI ‚Üí NIST control compliance flow

#### **STP Workflow Enhancement**
```
STIG Import ‚Üí CCI Mapping ‚Üí NIST Control Mapping ‚Üí STP Creation ‚Üí Compliance Scoring
```

**Status Badge Progression:**
- `Open` (Red) ‚Üí `STP Active` (Blue) ‚Üí `STP Passed` (Green)
- `Not Reviewed` (Orange) ‚Üí `STP Active` (Blue) ‚Üí `STP Passed` (Green)
- `Not a Finding` (Green) - static compliance state
- `Not Applicable` (Black) - static compliance state

#### **Implementation Components:**

**1. CCI-to-NIST Mapping Service**
- Import and maintain CCI control mappings
- Real-time mapping during STIG scan import
- Database schema for CCI ‚Üí NIST control relationships

**2. Enhanced STP Workflow**
- Control-based finding grouping (vs individual STIG findings)
- Bulk selection by NIST control family (AC, AU, CM, etc.)
- Auto-generate test cases per vulnerability/STIG ID
- Evidence collection and validation workflow

**3. Scoring Algorithm (Simplified, No Weighting)**
```typescript
interface SystemScore {
  assessmentCompleteness: number;  // 0-100%
  overallCompliance: number;       // 0-100% (reviewed findings only)

  // Separate CAT tracking (no mathematical weighting)
  catScores: {
    CAT_I: CategoryScore;
    CAT_II: CategoryScore;
    CAT_III: CategoryScore;
  };

  findings: {
    total: number;
    notReviewed: number;
    open: number;
    compliant: number;
  };
}
```

**4. Group/Package Compliance Logic**
- **Group Score**: Lowest-scoring system determines group compliance
- **Package Score**: Lowest-scoring group determines package compliance
- **Control Compliance**: Any CAT I finding = Non-Compliant
- **Assessment Status**: "Not Reviewed" findings block compliance scoring

**5. Scan Version History & STP Continuity**
- Preserve STP completion status across scan imports
- Maintain audit trail of assessment changes
- Version control for scan data while preserving manual assessments

#### **Database Schema Updates Required:**
```sql
-- CCI to NIST Control mappings
model CciControlMapping {
  id         Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  cci        String @unique
  controlId  String // e.g., "AC-2"
  controlTitle String
}

-- Enhanced scoring with separate CAT tracking
model SystemScore {
  assessmentCompleteness Float
  overallCompliance      Float

  catITotal     Int
  catIOpen      Int
  catICompliant Int

  catIITotal     Int
  catIIOpen      Int
  catIICompliant Int

  catIIITotal     Int
  catIIIOpen      Int
  catIIICompliant Int
}

-- STP status tracking on findings
// Add to StigFinding model:
controlId     String? // Mapped during import
stpStatus     String? @default("None") // None, Active, Passed
lastStpId     Int?    // Reference to most recent STP
```

#### **RMF Center Integration Strategy**
**Keep It Simple:** Pass only essential compliance data to RMF Center:
```typescript
interface ControlComplianceData {
  controlId: string;
  systemsAffected: number;
  totalFindings: number;
  openFindings: number;
  assessmentComplete: boolean;
  highestSeverityOpen: 'CAT_I' | 'CAT_II' | 'CAT_III' | null;
  status: 'Compliant' | 'Non_Compliant' | 'Assessment_Incomplete';
}
```

**Information Flow:**
`RMF Control ‚Üí "Non-Compliant (2 CAT I, 5 CAT II)" ‚Üí Click ‚Üí VC System Details`

#### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] STIG findings automatically mapped to NIST controls via CCI
- [ ] Package compliance reflects worst-case system/group scoring
- [ ] STP workflow integrated with NIST control framework
- [ ] Real-time compliance calculation as STIG data changes
- [ ] Clear drill-down path from RMF Center to detailed vulnerability data
